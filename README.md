# Research Data Repository

This repository contains experimental data related to my research in quantum information processing and computational physics. The data is organized based on different experiments and simulations conducted during my research.

## Repository Structure

The structure of each experiment directory may vary depending on the specific experiment. A general example:

```
ðŸ“‚ works/
    â”œâ”€â”€ experiment_name1/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ raw_data.csv
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ processed_data.csv
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis.ipynb
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code  # Contains scripts for data generation and analysis
    â”œâ”€â”€ experiment_name2/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ simulation_results.npy
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ figures/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plot1.png
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plot2.png
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ analysis_script.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

- **`works/`**: Contains all experimental and simulation data.
- The contents of each experiment directory depend on the nature of the experiment.
- Some experiments may include `code`, raw datasets, processed data, scripts, figures, or Jupyter notebooks.

## Usage

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/research-data.git
cd research-data
```

### Running Analysis

Depending on the experiment, you may need to use Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, or other tools. For example:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

or

```bash
python analysis_script.py
```

### Extracting Code for Reproduction

If an experiment includes `code.zip`, extract it as follows:

```bash
unzip code.zip -d code
cd code
```

Refer to the included `README.md` inside each experiment directory for specific instructions.
